# Gooee Mod for Cities Skylines 2

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Gooee, a Cities Skylines 2 mod designed to blend the conventions of Bootstrap with the game UI to provide a framework for modders to build rich UIs easily.

On top of that it also provides a framework of re-usable React components that are all custom made to try and fit into the game's UI whilst blending Bootstrap elements.

The mod provides an MVC (Model View Controller) system to easily setup your UI system, inject it and setup bindings for your model automatically.

Please note, this is a very early alpha and documentation is still WIP. Bugs are likely so it's not really recommended you use this in your mods just yet. But hopefully soon it will be in a useable state.

## Features
-- **Bootstrap-like CSS classes**
-- **Font Awesome 6 included**
-- **Inject UI into various places in the game's UI**
-- **Model View Controller paradigm**
-- **Automatic binding setup**
-- **Re-usable React components wrapping in the Bootstrap-like elements.
-- **Inject JS scripts and CSS stylesheets with your Plugin**
